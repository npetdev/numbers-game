# ðŸŽ² Numbers Game

A 3Ã—3 numbers game built with **React, Vite, TypeScript, and CSS**. Players choose a starting number (1â€“6), roll numbers, hold tiles, and try to match all tiles to the chosen number to win. Click a number to hold it (turns green), press **Roll** to randomize unheld numbers, track your roll count, and use **Reset** to start over. Before the first roll, tiles show a ðŸŽ² placeholder. Fully responsive and mobile-friendly with smooth hover and active animations.

2. Click **Roll** to randomize all tiles that are not yet held.  
3. Click on a number to **hold it** if it matches your chosen number (turns green).  
4. Continue rolling until **all numbers match the chosen number**.  
5. Track the number of rolls it took.  
6. Use **Reset** to start a new game at any time.  
7. When all numbers are held, the **WinnerPage** is displayed.
